# Good way to do academic research (Manual research)

## Search for articles about area of your interest
- Scholar is a good resource https://scholar.google.com/
- Check the citations, if there is Harvard mentioned, you should check that journal
- Skip thesis, some seminars might be worth your while, but they aren't usually peer-reviewed
- Search for the journal in JUFO https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali
- To see how good source it is
- Use the name of the journal when searching

## How to check the quality of the article quickly
1. Read the heading. Main thing is summed in the title
2. Read the Abstract
- Decide if you want to read further.
3. Check the end
- For example conclusions
- After that results or evaluations
4. If it is what you were looking for. Read it
- If there are some interesting results and conclusions it should be interesting to read

## Research articles like a pro
1. Do your research before choosing the thesis target.
- Can be part of one big famous reviewed article
- Time for research is usually limited, so do it before, rather than after you have chosen your objective
2. Search with Scholar
3. Check the journal in Jufo
4. Check for PDF file in Scholar
5. To check a good science source, check for peer reviews
- Add magic word to Scholar search add review after the letter.
- Survey is synonym for article
- Preferable fresh, within 2 years
- There are experts that have done the reading for you and summarized the contects
- They give you overlook on the area you are looking into
- Look for framework and summary pictures within the reviews as they give you a bigger picture

# 1. Prompt Template for Detailed Use Case Analysis (Academic Style)
- Role and Context:
- "Please act as a researcher and academic writing assistant. I am working on an academic research assignment and need detailed analysis on the implementation of [technology/topic, e.g., Kubernetes] in specific companies. I'll provide you a list of sources. Using only these sources, provide detailed answers structured in the following way."

## Task Instructions:
Using only the provided sources:

1. Identify and clearly state the implementation use cases for each of the listed companies, structured separately for each organization.
2. For each organization, answer clearly:
- What was the use case?
(Clearly state the business or technical context/problem addressed.)
- How was the technology implemented?
(Explain clearly the process or method of implementation, including details on previous solutions or alternative technologies considered if available.)
- Why was the technology chosen?
(Provide clear, concise reasons why the company selected this technology, emphasizing the expected benefits, improvements, or measurable impacts.)
3. Provide specific numerical values or concrete examples whenever available to measure impacts, highlight improvements, or indicate the scale of the issue solved.
4. Format your response using a clear, structured academic style:
- Clearly defined headings and subheadings.
- Logical progression from "What" → "How" → "Why".
- Essay-style paragraphs for clarity and readability.
- Practical, concrete examples.
- Analytical yet concise language.
5. Finally, provide a concise summary comparing the implementation decisions across the organizations analyzed, highlighting common reasons for selection and notable differences based on industry or organizational context.

## Example (Share your own list of sources like below):
- Example Source List (Provide your own):
- Author, Year. Title of source. Publisher. Available at: URL. Accessed: Date.
- (Continue the source list as required.)

## How to use:
- Copy and customize the prompt above with your specific topic and list of sources.
- Provide this prompt clearly to your AI assistant (ChatGPT).
- Receive structured, academic-style analysis and documentation consistently.


# 2. All-in-One Prompt for Generating Personalized Content
- Here’s a comprehensive prompt that guides the user step by step through the process of generating personalized content while ensuring all necessary inputs are gathered dynamically. It works as a single prompt chain, where the AI responds with clarifying questions based on user input.
- Prompt (copy everything under this and paste it to ChatGTP):
- I need to create a professional content piece for a school or work project, such as a social media post, blog article, or strategic report. The final text should reflect my unique writing style and integrate key insights from reference materials.
- To ensure the best result, I will go through the following steps.
1. Defining the Writing Style – I will first provide a writing sample or describe the desired style.
2. Sharing Reference Material – I will provide any relevant links, documents, or key messages.
3. Refining the Content Through an Interview – I will answer detailed questions to clarify the purpose, structure, and depth of the content.
4. Setting the Desired Length – I will specify word count, character count, or page length.
- Let’s begin!

## Step 1: Define the Writing Style
- To ensure the text aligns with my style, I will either:
- Provide a short writing sample (paste a few sentences or a paragraph).
- Describe how I want the writing to feel (e.g., formal, analytical, engaging, direct, or exploratory).
- [Wait for user response. If needed, ask follow-up questions like: “Would you like the style to be more conversational or expert-like?”]

## Step 2: Provide Reference Material
- Now, I will share the key materials that should be incorporated into the text. These can be:
- Documents, links, or reports with important insights.
- Key messages or themes that must be included.
- Any specific guidelines that need to be followed (e.g., structure, branding, tone).
- [Wait for user response. If no references are available, ask: “Would you like to proceed with general industry insights or create content from scratch?”]

## Step 3: Refining the Content Through an Interview
- To make the content truly personalized, I will answer the following questions:
- Defining the Core Message
- What is the main objective of this content?
- What key message or takeaway should the reader have?
- Are there any specific themes or perspectives I want to emphasize?
- Connecting to My Experience
- How have I encountered this topic in my work?
- Do I have real-world examples or case studies to include?
- What are my personal insights or reflections on this topic?
- Integrating References with My Own Perspective
- How do the reference materials connect to my own experience?
- Would I like to compare different perspectives, challenge existing views, or support a specific argument?
- Are there any nuances or unique takes I want to highlight?
- [Wait for responses, following up with clarifications if needed.]

## Step 4: Define the Desired Length
- To finalize, I will specify the ideal length:
- Word count (e.g., 500 words, 1,000 words)
- Character count if applicable.
- Page length if formatting is a concern.
- [Wait for response.]

## Final Step: Generate the Content
- Once all inputs are gathered, generate the structured content based on:
- Introduction – Defines the topic, objectives, and key concepts.
- User’s Perspective and Experience – Integrates personal insights with reference material.
- Discussion and Analysis – Connects real-world applications with insights.
- Conclusion – Summarizes key insights and possible implications.
- References (if applicable) – Properly formatted citations if external sources are used.
- Now, let’s start! Please provide a writing sample or describe the desired style.
